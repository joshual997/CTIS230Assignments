<h1>Song Lyric Analysis</h1>

<h2>Beyonce Song</h2>
<p>The <strong>strongest</strong> part of the draft in my opinion is the <em>ethos</em> section. Good reasons are provided as to why <strong>Beyonce</strong> is a <em>credible</em> source to explain this topic to us. A part I got confused on was in the <em>logos</em> section. It seemed like <em>emotion</em> was talked about a lot in this section and would have been more fit for the <em>pathos</em> section of the writing. I think one way that the writer could improve is to try and find a lyric for the <em>ethos</em> section to already <strong>strengthen</strong>the <strong>strongest</strong> part. They already have lyrics for the other two sections so one more lyric would be great.</p>


<h2>Billy Joel Song</h2>
<p>The <strong>strongest</strong> part of the draft in my opinion is the author's personal relationship to the song. They personally related to this song and explained why it meant so much to them and evoked <em>emotional</em> response in them. That makes them seem really <em>credible</em> and is evidence for <em>emotion</em>. One question I have is what makes <strong>Billy Joel</strong> credible to tell people to slow down in growing up? Did he go through something like that? One piece of advice I have is that maybe you can use key words to kind of let the reader know what you are specifically talking about. Like <em>logic</em>, <em>emotion</em>, <em>credibility</em>.</p>
